Hello I'm Johnny, In my free time I enjoy learning new technologies, checking out best practices for software development, and contributing to Open SRC projects on GitHub. I love the opportunities GitHub provides for us awesome developers to collaborate, share knowledge, bring our own uniqueness, and build rad software together. Currently pursuing my BSCC degree in Cloud Computing and striving for excellence to gain more experience & skills to help others on their path as well. I describe myself as having a fascination wanting to learn new technologies and dive deep into the unknown whether it be  for hardware, software, backend, frontend, or scripting. I still have A LOT to learn, but thats what makes the journey well worth it, always. Even though I'm specializing in Cloud Computing, I still consider myself a generalist because there's just way too much good info to pass up on nowadays lol. Thank you for checking out my hub and take it easy!
